This project is based on "The Big Nerd Ranch Guide: iPhone Programming Guide".  The original application was based on xCode 3.x and was designed for iPad only. 

This version is based on xCode 4 and supports iPhone and iPad.  The functionality is identical and every effort has been made to generate the code exactly as implemented in the text.  A single code base supports the iPhone and iPad.

Please read comments in the code.  They may be helpful.

This project is the Homepwner application described in chapter 10 of the text.  This project spanns 6x chapters. The name of THIS project is HomepwnerUniOne (Uni: Universal platform).  The name has no other significance other than to distinguish it from the sample project in the text and on line.
 
This code has been deployed to an iPhone 4 and iPad I and works sucessfully.
